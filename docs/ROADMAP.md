# FieldDay Product Roadmap

> **Mission**: Play anything, anywhere, with people you trust.

## Strategic Vision

FieldDay is building a **Sports OS** that unifies recreational sports through a trust-first data moat:

**Four Verticals**:

1. **Adult Pickup** - Instant game discovery (<200ms) and joining (<20s)
2. **Water Sports** - Condition-aware partner matching (surf, kite, spearo, sailing)
3. **Youth Logistics** - Family OS (multi-child, carpools, volunteers, medical)
4. **Facilities** - Inventory optimization (courts, fields, ramps, pricing)

**Data Moat**:

- **Reliability Graph**: 0-100 score (attendance, punctuality, safety)
- **Skill Graph**: 1-10 per sport with coach verification
- **Conditions Graph**: Real-time weather/water + safety alerts
- **City-by-City**: Local trust networks create defensibility

**Result**: Superior liquidity, retention (reliability reduces no-shows 60%+), and margins (city-level network effects).
