# FieldDay Mission & Vision

> **Play anything, anywhere, with people you trust.**

## The Problem

Recreational sports face three critical failures:

1. **Discovery Friction**: Finding games/partners takes too long (avg 45+ minutes of texting/calling)
2. **Trust Deficit**: No-shows plague pickup games (30-40% no-show rate industry-wide)
3. **Fragmentation**: Players juggle 5+ apps (Spond, TeamSnap, weather apps, payment apps, facility booking)

**Result**: People play less, organizers burn out, facilities sit empty 60%+ of the time.

## The Solution: FieldDay Sports OS

FieldDay unifies recreational sports across **four critical verticals** through a **trust-first data moat**:

### Four Verticals

#### 1. Adult Pickup Games

**Problem**: Can't find games fast enough; unreliable players ruin experience
**Solution**:

- Instant discovery (<200ms p95) with geospatial matching
- One-tap join (<20s from discovery to calendar)
- Reliability scoring (0-100) filters out flakes
- Auto-waitlists fill cancellations

**Impact**: 2x more games played per month; 60% reduction in no-shows

#### 2. Water Sports Partner-Finding

**Problem**: Dangerous to go alone; conditions change rapidly; hard to find compatible partners
**Solution**:

- Real-time condition matching (wind, swell, tide, visibility)
- Float plan integration with emergency contacts
- Auto-cancel when conditions violate safety thresholds
- Partner compatibility (skill level, preferred conditions, boat capacity)

**Impact**: 3x more water sessions; zero incidents from condition-related accidents

#### 3. Youth Sports Logistics

**Problem**: Parents drowning in chaos managing multiple kids across teams
**Solution**:

- Family OS dashboard (one view for all kids' activities)
- Carpool coordination with QR code pickup handoff
- Volunteer matrix with fair auto-assignment
- Medical cards + incident reporting with return-to-play workflows
- Guardian-visible messaging (adult↔minor DMs blocked)

**Impact**: 10 hours/week saved per family; 100% COPPA compliance; zero safety violations

#### 4. Facility Management

**Problem**: Courts/fields sit empty 60%+ of time; manual scheduling; no pricing optimization
**Solution**:

- Dynamic pricing based on demand/utilization
- Real-time inventory (courts, fields, ramps, ice)
- Staff/referee scheduling with payout tracking
- Utilization analytics and forecasting
- API integrations for external bookings

**Impact**: 30%+ utilization increase; 2x revenue per facility

## The Data Moat: Trust-First Graph

FieldDay's defensibility comes from a **three-dimensional trust graph** that competitors cannot replicate:

### 1. Reliability Graph

**Tracks**: Attendance, punctuality, cancellations, incident-free rate
**Output**: 0-100 reliability score with decay function (recent behavior weighted higher)
**Enforcement**: Organizers set minimum thresholds (e.g., "Must have 80+ reliability")
**Badges**: No-Flake (95%+ attendance), Safety-First, Early-Bird, Community-Leader

**Data Moat**: After 6 months in a city, we have comprehensive reliability data on 80%+ of active players. New entrants start from zero.

### 2. Skill Graph

**Tracks**: Self-reported skill (1-10 per sport), coach verifications, progression over time
**Output**: Per-sport skill ratings with confidence intervals
**Verification**: Coaches can verify/adjust player skills; ladder rankings auto-update skills
**Matching**: "Looking for 6-8 skill level players" filters work instantly

**Data Moat**: Skill verification requires trusted coaches in-network. Takes 12+ months to build coach trust graph.

### 3. Conditions Graph

**Tracks**: Historical weather/water data correlated with session outcomes
**Sources**: NOAA, OpenWeather, Windy, local sensors
**Output**: Predictive safety scores, auto-cancel triggers, optimal time windows
**Learning**: ML model learns which conditions lead to cancellations/incidents per sport/location

**Data Moat**: Historical conditions + outcome data = predictive advantage. Requires 2+ years of data per location.

## City-by-City Playbook

FieldDay's **unit of expansion is the city**, not the sport:

### Phase 1: Seed (Weeks 1-4)

- Partner with 3-5 top organizers (soccer, volleyball, tennis)
- 50 free sessions to build initial supply
- Guarantee $500/month minimum for early organizers

### Phase 2: Liquidity (Weeks 5-12)

- Reach critical mass: 20+ sessions/week
- Launch reliability scoring (requires 10+ sessions per user)
- Add facilities (2-3 partners)
- Expand to water sports (beach launch)

### Phase 3: Network Effects (Months 4-6)

- Reliability graph active (1000+ scored users)
- Facility APIs live (auto-sync calendars)
- Family OS launched (youth teams onboarding)
- 100+ sessions/week across all verticals

### Phase 4: Defensible (Months 7-12)

- 5000+ users with reliability scores
- Skill verification active (coaches endorsing)
- Conditions graph predicting optimal times
- New entrants face cold-start problem

**Result**: After 12 months, FieldDay owns the local trust graph. Competitors cannot replicate without 12 months of data.

## Core Principles

### 1. Trust-First

Every feature must enhance trust, reliability, or safety. When in doubt, prioritize user safety over convenience.

**Examples**:

- Adult↔minor DMs blocked at API level (no exceptions)
- Background checks required for all coaches
- Float plans required for offshore water activities
- Incident reporting with return-to-play workflows

### 2. Mobile-First

Optimize for quick actions on mobile (<20s user flows). Desktop is secondary.

**Examples**:

- Instant join: Tap → Deposit → Calendar in <20s
- Quick filters: "Tonight", "This Weekend", "Next Week"
- One-tap carpool confirmation with QR code

### 3. Performance-Obsessed

- Session discovery: <200ms p95
- Join flow: <20s end-to-end
- Payment processing: <3s
- Calendar sync: <30s

### 4. Condition-Aware

Weather/water conditions are first-class citizens, not afterthoughts.

**Examples**:

- Auto-cancel surf session if swell drops below threshold
- Suggest alternative times when conditions improve
- Safety alerts for small craft advisories

### 5. Family-Centric

Support multi-child households with complex logistics.

**Examples**:

- Sibling discount (automatic 10%+ for 2+ kids)
- Conflict detection across all family calendars
- Fair volunteer distribution (auto-balances across families)

## Success Metrics

### North Star Metrics

1. **Event Fill Rate**: % of sessions reaching minimum capacity (Target: 85%+)
2. **Time-to-First-Game**: Days from signup to first session attended (Target: <3 days)
3. **No-Show Rate**: % of registered users who don't show up (Target: <10%)
4. **Organizer NRR**: Net Revenue Retention for organizers (Target: 120%+)
5. **D30 Retention**: % of users active after 30 days (Target: 60%+)

### City Health Metrics

- Sessions per week (Target: 100+ by Month 6)

## Competitive Moats

### Why FieldDay Wins

1. **Cross-Vertical Integration**: Competitors focus on one vertical. We unify all four.

   - TeamSnap (youth only) can't do adult pickup
   - Spond (team sports) can't do water conditions
   - PlayYourCourt (tennis only) can't scale to all sports

2. **Trust Graph**: Reliability/Skill/Conditions data creates compounding defensibility.

   - After 12 months: 5000+ users with reliability scores
   - After 24 months: Predictive conditions model, coach endorsement network
   - New entrants face 18-24 month cold-start problem

3. **City-by-City Playbook**: Local network effects create winner-take-all dynamics.

   - Once FieldDay has 80%+ of active players in a city, organizers must use our platform
   - Once organizers use FieldDay, players follow (supply creates demand)

4. **Family Lock-In**: Multi-child households have 10x higher LTV and 5x lower churn.

   - Managing 2-3 kids across teams = complex logistics
   - Once a family's data is in FieldDay (medical, carpools, volunteers), switching cost is massive

5. **Facility APIs**: Integration with facility management systems creates supply-side lock-in.
   - Real-time slot availability = competitive advantage
   - Facilities don't want to manage multiple platforms

## Vision: The Sports Operating System

By 2030, FieldDay becomes the **default infrastructure for recreational sports**:

- **For Players**: "I want to play soccer tonight" → FieldDay finds a game in <20s
- **For Organizers**: "I need to fill my clinic" → FieldDay fills it 2x faster with reliable players
- **For Parents**: "Manage my kids' sports" → FieldDay handles scheduling, carpools, volunteers automatically
- **For Facilities**: "Maximize revenue" → FieldDay optimizes pricing and utilization

**Result**: More people playing more sports more often, with less friction and more trust.
